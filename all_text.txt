ConfidentialFavorable policy changes replacing the obsolete system of memorization -based learningOnly around 40% of 5 -year -olds possess the ability to read letters
The numbers still remain low for 6-7-year -olds at 60% and 70% for children aged 8 and above
In India, traditional early learning through memorization has resulted in huge dropout rates & unemployable youth
The NEP Policy promotes holistic and multidisciplinary education, skill development and a flexible learning approach
It has replaced the previous education policy, which had been in effect since 1986
The focus is now on learning through interaction with materials, activities and environments
The aim is to develop essential skills through play and experience

11In 2016, FSG approached
PIPE aims to replace rote with activity -based learning in all 
300,000 affordable private schools in IndiaProgram to Improve Private Early Education (PIPE)
Other Participants in PIPE:
"In India, 300,000+ Affordable Private Schools (APSs) educate 
50%+ of school -going children1, 2, 3. However, learning 
outcomes are poor in its current state. FSG’s Program to Improve 
Private Early Education (PIPE) aims to replace rote with activity -
based learning in the 300,000 affordable private schools in India. 
The program has led to 8 activity -based learning solution 
providers serving >74,000 children from low -income families 
with activity -based learning.
Kreedo (one of our eight partners) improves learning outcomes 
by providing APSs with classroom material, children kits, 
structured lesson plans and intensive teacher training. Kreedo 
provides >150 affordable, durable and developmentally 
appropriate materials for children to play and learn with. In 
addition to initial teacher training, their teams visit schools every 
two months to support teachers implement and advice owners 
on engaging with teachers and parents.
Within 3 years, Kreedo has scaled from serving ~20 APSs to >150 
APSs. PIPE’s independent assessment has shown that children in 
Kreedo schools perform 50% better as compared to children in 
neighboring private schools. "Testimonial

It was during the crucial time of the pandemic that Kreedo came up with its Practivity 
toybox. Since then, the unique box has been helping children learn independently from 
their homes with minimal parental supervision.
 
It helped us run our preschool without worrying about the drop -off and made us optimistic
to face any challenge. 
Thanks from the bottom of our hearts.We named our preschool ‘Funshala’ because we were sure of the fun children would 
experience through Kreedo’s child -centric curriculum. The curriculum following an 
activity -based learning approach attracts children, making learning synonymous with fun.
I am grateful to Kreedo because they made it possible for women entrepreneurs like me 
to successfully run our preschools amidst the pandemic. 
Thank you Kreedo.Manjary Singh
Funshala Kindergarten
Everyone echoed Kreedo as the best curriculum provider and we decided to go ahead with 
them. And to date, Kreedo is the best decision we’ve ever made. 
Since partnering, they have aided us in set up the ideal learning environment.
Their continuous support assists us to run our preschool efficiently. 
The 6T application helps us to implement the curriculum better.Abhishek Tiwari
Tejaswi Early Education Centre (Pre School)
It was right after the first demo class, I decided to introduce the Kreedo curriculum in my 
preschool. What impresses me the most till date, is the instant and detailed response we 
get from the team.
It is a matter of joy to see the children doing mathematics, enriching their vocabulary 
through learning new words and framing sentences on their own.Kanchana Kumari
